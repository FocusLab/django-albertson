DjangoSettingsMixin
===================

`dj_albertson.mixins.DjangoSettingsMixin`

This mixin provides automatic loading of default settings for a CounterPool
from the django settings module.

Below is an example use::

    from albertson import CounterPool
    from dj_albertson.mixins import DjangoSettingsMixin

    class MyCounter(DjangoSettingsMixin, CounterPool):
        '''
        That's it, your done!
        '''

Once you've added this mixin to your counter pool classes, the following
settings will be used:

:ALBERTSON_AWS_ACCESS_KEY:
    The AWS access key id that will be used to access DynamoDB.  This is the
    setting that will be used if both `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `ALBERTSON_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` are provided.

:ALBERTSON_AWS_SECRET_KEY:
    The AWS secet key that will be used to access DynamoDB.  This is the
    setting that will be used if both `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
    `ALBERTSON_AWS_SECRET_KEY` are provided.

:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
    A more generic form of `ALBERTSON_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`

:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
    A more generic form of `ALBERTSON_AWS_SECRET_KEY`

:ALBERTSON_DEFAULT_READ_UNITS:
    The default read throughput that will be set on newly created tables.

    **default:** 3

:ALBERTSON_DEFAULT_WRITE_UNITS:
    The default write throughput that will be set on newly created tables.

    **default:** 5

:ALBERTSON_AUTO_CREATE_TABLE:
    A flag to control how Albertson should behave when it tries to use a
    table that doesn't exist.  If set to `True`, Albertson will create a new
    table.  If set to `False`, Albertson will allow the underlying boto
    exception to bubble up through the stack.

    **default:** True
